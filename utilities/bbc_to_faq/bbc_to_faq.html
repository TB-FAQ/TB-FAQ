		This document was automatically generated with the <span class="faq_hoverExplain" title="BBcode to FAQ"><span class="faq_code_snippet">bbc_to_faq</span></span> toolset. Everything you see here can be done with the <span class="faq_code_snippet">bbc_to_faq</span> toolset.

	<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What is <span class="faq_code_snippet">bbc_to_faq</span>?</p>
	<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> <p><span class="faq_code_snippet">bbc_to_faq</span> is a toolset designed to replicate at least the functionality of BBcode on the forums. It is intended to allow you to write preliminary FAQ items in a more familiar language and with less repetitive overhead. It is also intended to allow the outlines of FAQ items to be quickly written out with less concern on the specifics of the formatting.</p><p>To the best of its ability, the toolset will attempt to generate code which is at least technically correct for an FAQ item, and which should require significantly less work to clean up than writing it in full in the first place would be.</p>
	</div>
	<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Is there any difference between forum BBcode and the BBcode used by <span class="faq_code_snippet">bbc_to_faq</span>?</p>
	<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> <p><strong style="color:red">Yes.</strong><br/><span class="faq_code_snippet">bbc_to_faq</span> is intended to generate FAQ items, and is designed to automatically generate output which is compatible with that purpose. Though it is designed to look and function mostly like BBcode (for the sake of familiarity), it is designed to output complete FAQ items (as opposed to posts on forum). To this end, it has several tags which <em>will never be implemented</em> on the forums, because they allow too much flexibility and/or present legitimate security risks. These risks are identical to the risks associated with allowing posting directly in HTML, which is fine for the TB-FAQ project, but would be <strong style="color:red">a very bad idea</strong> on the forums.</p><p>Thus, some codes may seem to behave similarly to the forum's BBcodes, but several of them also have additional features. For example, the bold and italics tags, [b][/b] and [i][/i], in this toolset will accept an option parameter that will be passed to their <span class="faq_code_snippet">style</span> attribute. For example:<br/>[b="color:red"]Example[/b] becomes: <strong style="color:red">Example</strong></p><p><p class="faq_importantInfo">One other key difference is that "Q:" and "A:" are special dividers which represent question and answer segments. These will be automatically formatted before any BBcode is processed, and BBcode cannot be transferred across these segments.</p></p>

	<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> I need more tags!</p>
	<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> <p>Contact suomy on IRC, make an issue, or add them yourself. See <span class="faq_code_snippet">bbcode_parser.py</span> if you're interested on how to do that. In the case of standard tags, they will be added as they seem necessary, so if you want to prioritize a tag, use it in an FAQ item. Even if it doesn't work now, it will work by the time we go to merge it.</p>

	<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I use the <span class="faq_code_snippet">bbc_to_faq</span> tool to generate the HTML?</p>
	<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> <p>You will need Python (it was developed on Python 3.6.3, but lower versions of Python 3 may work). Then, open python in the same directory, <span class="faq_code_snippet">from bbc_to_faq import make_html_from_file</span>, and then <span class="faq_code_snippet">make_html_from_file(input_filename,output_filename)</span>.</p>
