This is a set of scripts that are being used to clean the templated files for cleaning to faq.php.

These were developed using Python 3.6.3 (32-bit) on a 64-bit Windows system.

They are not currently set up to support other operating systems or older versions of Python.

You will need the Python library `css-html-js-minify` installed to use these scripts.
