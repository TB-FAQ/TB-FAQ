Each part of the forum usually has its own additional rules which need to be followed <strong>in addition</strong> to the ones listed here. Occasionally, the local rules may override one or more of the global rules here. You must also still follow the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/faq.php?faq=rules_main#faq_global_rules">Global Rules</a>.</p>
