                                        Firstly, a decap prize is a <strong>PUBLIC</strong> mini event that is available in any server with the command <span class="faq_code_snippet">/decapprize [TC amount]</span> used to add any number between 1 and 20,000 TC to the server. The server will award said TC to the person that succeeded in decapping the other person's tori (assuming they also win the match).<br /><br />

                                        What is rigging a Decap Prize? Rigging a DP means you are setting up the DP to be taken by a specific user or users, be that anyone including yourself. This does not matter if the DP has "your TC" in it. If TC was added to the DP it was donated and, once donated, is no longer yours and you have NO CLAIM to it at that time or in the future. This means that any attempt to take the TC because "it was yours before you put it in" will be treated as a Decap Prize Rig. If you believe a DP was rigged, or you believe one is about to be rigged, please contact a Staff Member and/or make a Scam Report. <strong>TAKE SCREENSHOTS</strong> and please try to provide a replay.
                                        <strong>Secondary note:</strong> The type of server makes no difference, be it a tournament, bet server, public room etc. Decap prize is <em>public</em> prize and is to ALWAYS BE WON FAIRLY. Any deviation from this rule results in serious punishment.
