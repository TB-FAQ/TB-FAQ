					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What is a duel/wager?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> <strong>A duel is a match between two players in which they both wager items, TC, or any other tradeable item and the winner gets what was wagered.</strong><br/> Items which are wagered <em>must be</em> transferred to the winner of the duel.
					<p class="bold">Things to Remember</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The original agreement for the duel must include: what items you are dueling for and how many games you are going to play. <strong>Keep a record of this agreement (Ideally, take a screenshot of the rules and the agreement between parties).</strong></li>
						<li>After each fight, announce the score and <strong>take screens</strong>.</li>
						<li>Standard ingame rules apply. Be civil during a duel. <em>Don't expect help if you flame, kick or mute your opponents.</em></li>
						<li>Give your opponent a few minutes (or whatever time is reasonable in the circumstances) to send the payment. <em>Payments should be sent immediately whenever possible.</em> Waiting a long time <em>may very well get you banned</em> on suspicion of scamming.</li>
						<li><strong>You must have the items or TC you wager in your account at the beginning of the duel.</strong> <strong style="color:red">Dueling with items or TC you don't have in your account is considered a scam.</strong> These items must be on the account you are dueling with, <em>not a bank or an alternate account.</em></li>
						<li>Check your opponent's inventory before you duel them. You won't be able to win items or TC which they don't have. <em>You can report them in the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=518">Scam Reports</a> board if they attempt to duel with items they do not have in their account.</em></li>
						<li>If you're using the <span class="faq_code_snippet">/duel</span> mode and there is a glitch that sinks the TC, you can only get a refund for the TC taken from your account by the glitch.</li>
					</ol>
					<p style="font-weight:bold">Duel Rules</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Wagers must be verifiably owned quantities which can be legitimately transferred between the two players immediately after a duel.
							<ol>
								<li>Textures cannot be verifiably owned as of yet, nor can USD or other forms of "real" currency.</li>
								<li>One cannot use duelling as a basis to transfer qi, or to bypass qi or other trade restrictions on items. <em>You must be able to send your wager yourself.</em></li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>The agreement to the duel should be accepted by both parties and screenshotted by both parties to that effect. Any changes made to the mod or game rules (e.g. realtimeghosts) must be stated and agreed to by both parties - screenshots of the agreement and any such statements will be required, else the duel may be considered invalid. Lack of evidence may be prevent us from providing appropriate punishments/compensation in the case of a grievance.</li>
						<li>Duels should be of a competitive nature, based in skill and not luck. Duels such as "1 match of wtf.tbm" will not be supported. Any mod is allowed, but at least 3 games is recommended.</li>
						<li>If a player disconnects during a duel, it is counted as a loss for the disconnecting player, unless they both agree to have a rematch. In the event that a player cannot complete the match (whether intentionally or by accident), they will be considered in violation of the duelling agreement, and forfeit the duel as a whole.</li>
						<li>We cannot and will not support "soft" rules such as "no shovel" or "no running", due to the ambiguous nature of the terms. <em>Change the mod to favor the tactics you would prefer to see in the duel, such as adding or removing the dojo.</em> Any duel made on the basis of a soft rule will be discarded in the case of a report, unless it was done abusively, in which case the offending party will be banned.</li>
						<li>In the event of an agreed upon duel with a provable winner that follows all of the above rules, the prize will be guaranteed (to a reasonable, best-effort extent) by the Toribash administration. The loser of the duel is obligated to send the prize, and in the event of their failure to do so, they will be punished <em>and the prize will be sent for them</em>.
							<ol>
								<li>The definition of the best-effort clause does not include the creation of new items or TC, and in the event that it would be unsightly or difficult to acquire the agreed upon items from the responsible party, other items or TC may be appropriated instead. This is done on a case-by-case basis, as necessary, based on market value of the agreed upon items or TC.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>If non-standard settings are used, both parties must be aware of the changes before the duel starts. Should unconventional settings be used, such as advantageous gravity settings, the duel will be void, winnings returned, and the responsible party for using unfair settings may be banned.</li>
