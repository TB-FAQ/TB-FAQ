					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> I have been banned, what can I do?</p>
					<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> First, please read your ban reason.
					
					<p>If you have any questions about your ban, or believe it was made in error or is unreasonably long feel free to post in the Ban Appeals board which is visible to banned users on the forum. The purpose of the Ban Appeals board is to explain any questions about the ban and the rulebreaking the led to the ban you may have. Additionally, if it becomes apparent that it was a genuine misunderstanding of the rules on your part, or of the situation on our part, the ban may be reduced or removed entirely.</p>
					
					<p>Note however that in clear cases of rule breaking, most bans will not be shortened during an initial appeal. If you have been permanently banned or for more than three months, it is unlikely that your ban will be reduced to less than three months. You, of course, may still post an appeal to request additional information about your ban, for instructions on what you can do to help us believe that shortening the ban would be alright for all parties involved.</p>
					</div>
					
					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> I don't see any other posts in Ban Appeals, does anyone actually use this board?</p>
					<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> <strong>Yes.</strong>
					
					<p>Only Toribash Community staff members may see the threads of other users. Banned users can only see their own threads in Ban Appeals, so if you have never posted an appeal before it will appear empty.</p>
					</div>
					
					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Can I see the evidence against me associated with my ban?</p>
					<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> <strong>Sometimes.</strong>
					<p>In the case that the evidence is or was intentionally publicly available, we will be happy to link it. For example, if we banned you for blatantly spamming on the forums, we would be happy to link any such posts. Usually evidence of this type has already been PM'd to you in infraction messages, but infraction messages may be replicated upon request during your appeal.
					</p>
					
					<p>In the case of evidence that was provided confidentially by other users, we generally will not share such evidence out of respect for the other user's privacy. If it is clear that you should already know who reported you, such as if you are being accused of a duel scam, the evidence may be made available based on the discretion of the staff member handling your case.
					</p>
					
					<p>In the case of evidence that was acquired by the use of staff tools, usually, though usually not in complete form. Usually such evidence consists of IP logs associated with individual accounts, which are generally individually meaningless. As information such as "who's IP do you share?" is potentially harmful to others, we will not generally share such a list. 
					</p>
					
					<p>Recall that while Ban Appeals is here to help you understand your ban, we cannot always share the specific evidence behind your ban. In many cases we will strive to ensure that we are providing an accurate description of the evidence, and if you believe there is a discrepancy in the evidence you may always request that we double check it (again, likely).
					</p>
					</div>
					
					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How long does it take for an Appeal to be looked at?</p>
					<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> <strong>Please allow 24 hours after first posting your appeal.</strong>
					<p>The staff members are people too. By default, the person who banned you will usually be the one in charge of ensuring that your appeal is handled, but most of our staff members are not active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so they may not be available at the same time as you post your appeal.
					</p>
					</div>
					
					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Can I play on an alternate account?</p>
					<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> <strong>Usually.</strong>
					<p>In most cases, you are allowed to continue playing Toribash on an alternate account. You are expected to follow the rules on your alternate accounts: alternate accounts which are used to break the rules are usually permabanned, and your primary account will likely be banned or have its existing ban extended.
					</p>
					</div>
					
					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Why am I banned for something my brother did?</p>
					<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> <strong>You are responsible for activity on your accounts and your IP address.</strong>
					<p>We usually cannot reasonably prove that you and your family members are separate people, so we generally have to treat you as the same person. As such, if your sibling plays Toribash, please ensure that they also follow the rules.
					</p>
					</div>
					
					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> I can't see the Ban Appeals board?</p>
					<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> You are either <strong>not banned</strong> or have <strong>previously had your Ban Appeals access revoked</strong>.
					
					<p>Ban Appeals access is only revoked when you intentionally misuse or abuse the Ban Appeals board, and in all but the most egregious cases will be preceded by a strongly worded warning post in one of your threads. If you would like to be able to post in Ban Appeals in the future, please take any such warnings to heart.
