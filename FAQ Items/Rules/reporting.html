                            It's a good idea (and a timesaver for everyone) if you read the rules of whatever section of the forum you are reporting from. PMs are only subject to <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/faq.php?faq=rules#faq_global_rules">global rules</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="faq_admin">Staff:</span> If you believe that a staff member has broken the rules or has otherwise behaved inappropriately, please contact them directly about the situation first. If even after they have been given the opportunity to explain themselves you feel that they are still performing inappropriately as a staff member please post in the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=551">Staff Complaints board</a>.</li>
                        <li><span class="faq_smod">Everything else:</span> For any other rule violations or concerns, please post in the general <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=712">Reports</a> board.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        For us to process a report, evidence must be provided with the report. For scams, this would include screenshots of the deals involved. For any complaints regarding ingame activity, this would include screenshots of the rule infracting activities that cover enough to fully explain the situation. When reporting posts or private messages, any information not immediately present in the post or private should be added to the report message.

                        <p>Make sure to read up on how to take and share screenshots <strong><a href="http://forum.toribash.com/faq.php?faq=rules#faq_screenshots">here</a>.</strong> Two things to remember:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>ONLY SCREENSHOTS OF TORIBASH ITSELF ARE CONSIDERED AS EVIDENCE.</strong> Screenshots from Discord, Facebook, IRC, Skype or wherever else are <em>not</em> considered valid.</li>
                            <li><strong>SCREENSHOTS OF TORIBASH MUST NOT BE CROPPED OR EDITED.</strong> Only screenshots showing the entire window will be accepted as evidence, and screenshots that have been edited have a high chance of being rejected also.</li>
                        </ul>

                <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Someone is doing something that I think is against the rules, but I'm not sure. Can I report them?</p>
                <div class="faq_answer">

                        <span class="faq_a">A:</span>
                        <strong>Absolutely.</strong> We may discard your report if we find that their behavior isn't actually harmful or in violation of any rules, but <em>you do not need to know specifically which rule they are breaking to report them</em>. If someone is making you uncomfortable ingame, feel free to report them. The Toribash Community staff may or may not decide to take action, but you will not be punished for filing a report <em>unless</em> the report was intentionally meant to be a waste of our time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>If you are reporting too much, we'll tell you. If you haven't heard from us that you're reporting too much, then we don't think you are.</em>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> I don't see any posts in the (Scam) Reports board, is it actually used?</p>
                <div class="faq_answer">
                    <p>
                        <span class="faq_a">A:</span> <strong>Yes.</strong><br />
                        The Reports and Scam Reports board are set so that <strong>only you and staff members can see your posts in that board.</strong> If you are not a staff member, you will not be able to see any other user's reports. Furthermore, other users, including the user you are reporting, will not be able to see yours. With the exception of <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=551">Staff Complaints</a>, reports you make will be kept between you and the Toribash Community staff to the best of our ability to do so.

                        The Toribash Community staff are people too. We will do our best to handle reports in a timely fashion, but due to timezones and activities it may take time for reports to be handled. In the case of immediate issues, such as issues in an ingame room, you may <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/chat_view.php?channel=support">join the #support channel on IRC</a> and ask for assistance there. In cases like this, you should still be taking screenshots.
