						<div class="faq_importantInfo">
							Not giving out your password is the most important step to keeping your account secure.<br/>
							Only you have any need for your password. If another user asks you for your password, they are up to no good.</br>
							<em>Toribash Community staff will never ask you for your password. Toribash Community staff have no use for your password. <strong>Do not give your password to anyone, even if they are staff.</strong></em>
						</div>
						<p>
							It may seem silly, but most cases of account hijackings are the result of a user (knowingly or unknowingly) giving away their password.
							You are responsible for the activity on your account, so do not share your password with other people.
						</p>
						<p>
							Be especially wary of websites offering to-good-to-be-true deals that require your Toribash password.
							Such websites are being used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a>, and exist to steal your password.
							Never input your password on a website that doesn't end precisely with <span class="faq_code_snippet">toribash.com</span>.
						</p>

					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I make a good password?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Use a password manager.
						<p>
							A good password manager makes creating and using secure passwords very easy, and is recommended if you are concerned about the strength of your password.
							However, the bare minimum guidelines for a decent password are as follows:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Don't use the same password as you use on your email. This is very important -- don't let your email get stolen just because someone guessed your Toribash password.</li>
							<li>Don't use the same password as you use on any other site, for the same reason.</li>
							<li>Don't put your username in your password.</li>
							<li>Don't put <span class="faq_code_snippet">password</span> in your password.</li>
							<li>Don't use personally identifying information as your password, such as your birthday.</li>
							<li>If you insist on memorizing your password, ensure that it is longer than 8 characters.
								Instead of trying to memorize a complicated sequence of symbols, it may be better to randomly pick 4 or 5 words from the dictionary, chain them together, and stick a random number somewhere in the middle.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Pick passwords that other people will be utterly incapable of guessing, and do not give your password to anyone, and you should be fine.
						</p>
                        <p>If you're using a manager that doesn't create passwords for you, at least use another form of strong password creation (i.e <a href="https://passwordsgenerator.net/?length=16&symbols=1&numbers=1&lowercase=1&uppercase=1&similar=0&ambiguous=0&client=1&autoselect=1">Strong Random Password Generator</a>). <strong>It's usually unwise to try to make your own passwords!</strong>

                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I use a password manager?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Depends on the password manager, but it is usually quite simple.

                    <div class="faq_answer">
						<p><span class="faq_a">A:</span> The final piece of the puzzle when it comes to account security is common sense.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Toribash staff will never, ever ask for your password.</li>
							<li>You should never tell anybody your password under any circumstance.</li>
							<li>Make sure you have a decent firewall/antivirus on your device. A keylogger will completely undo even the strongest passwords.</li>
							<li>Only use your password to login to *.toribash.com, not t0ribash.org, tori.ru, toricredits.net or any other third-party site.</li>
							<li>Finally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make sure your account uses a real email which you can access.</span> If you ever need your password reset, this is an excellent method for us to verify who you are.</li>
							<ul><li>If you made your account ingame, you need to go to <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/usercp.php">User Control Panel</a> on the Forums to add an email to your account. It is very important that you do this so we can help you should something happen to your account.</li>
