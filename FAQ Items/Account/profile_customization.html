							If you only want to change the case of a letter in your username, it costs 5k per letter changed. For example, 'Fish' to 'FISH' costs 15k. This will not increase the price of future name changes.</p>

				<div class="faq_answer">
					<p><span class="faq_a">A:</span> You may increase the maximum size of your avatar or signature by purchasing <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/payments.php">Forum VIP</a>.</p>
					<p>If you would like for a larger avatar than VIP allows, you may also purchase a larger avatar from the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/showthread.php?t=572696">Profile and Item Customization Store</a>. You may not increase the size of your signature beyond the size that VIP allows.</p>
					<p><strong>Avatar sizes purchased through the Profile and Item Customization Store are specific to the avatar chosen at the time, and cannot be re-applied or transferred if you change your avatar. You will need to pay the customization price each time you wish to change your avatar to something larger than the VIP size.</strong></p>

					<p><span class="faq_a">A:</span>
						There are several ways to change your usertitle. If you have Forum VIP, you may change your usertitle whenever you wish to any plain text you desire (within the rules of the forum).</p>
						
						<p>You may also purchase a usertitle change containing some color and style customization at the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_usertitle.php">Usertitle shop</a> in the store. You can do this even if you do not have VIP.</p>
						
						<p>You may purchase even more complex usertitles from the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/showthread.php?t=572696">Profile and Item Customization Store</a>.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Keep in mind: If you purchase your usertitle and later change it, you will have to re-purchase it to change it back.</strong></p>
