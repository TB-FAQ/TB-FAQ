					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What are items?</p>
					<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Items are used to enhance the look and feel of the game, or as collectibles. A typical example of an item would be a joint color, such as the one shown below:<br/>
					<center><a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_shop_item.php?id=624"><img src="http://cache.toribash.com/forum/torishop/images/items/neptune_force.png" /></a></center></div>

                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Do items make you better in game?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> No. Items provide only cosmetic enhancements.</div>
					
					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How can I get items?</p>
					<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> All items cost Toricredits (TC) and can be bought in the Market from other players or from the Torishop. Some items are not available for TC in the ToriShop and can only be purchased with real currency. Most items require you to have a minimum amount of Qi before you can purchase or receive the item, and you need a minimum of 20 Qi to trade at all. The Qi requirement for an item can be found in the ToriShop. You may purchase an item with real currency even if you do not meet the Qi requirement.</div>

					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do people earn all the TC for these items?</p>
					<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> There are several ways to gain TC.
						<ul>
							<li>Winning in game on official servers nets you 10 Toricredits (or more, if you have boosters), per win.</li>
							<li>Winning in game tournaments can net you anywhere from 50 to 10,000 (or more!) Toricredits!</li>
							<li>Winning events can net you serious Toricredits depending on the event prizes. Check the <a href="http:/forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=37">Events</a> board for details.</li>
							<li>Trading items in the Market can be very profitable.</li>
							<li>You can also make and sell artwork for signatures, avatars, and textures in the Market boards.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Simply go to the Shop, then to your deactivated inventory, find the item and click 'activate'.
						<ul class="faq_spacedList">
							<li>Shop: <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori.php" target="_blank">http://forum.toribash.com/tori.php</a></li>
							<li>Deactivated inventory: <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_inventory.php" target="_blank">http://forum.toribash.com/tori_inventory.php</a></li>

                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What about flames?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> For flames, you can go <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=366" target="_blank">here</a> to buy pre-made ones, as well as going ingame and going to the menu screen and clicking Setup > Utils > Flame Browser.

						<p>If you go ingame and hit escape, or are on the menu screen, you can go Setup > Utils > Flame Forger to make your own flames.</p>

						<p>A flame can have various effects depending on the way the forger manipulates it, but it it always centered around a chosen joint.</p>

						<p>When you have a flame, you can also apply an image to the particle with a flame particle texture. Flame particle textures make each particle represent the image you apply to it.<br/>
						<em>Note: without a flame, the flame particle texture does nothing!</em></p>

						<p>For more in depth, and how to use each specific tweak, you can look <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/showthread.php?t=90638" target="_blank">here</a>. (outdated source, but the concept is the same)</p>
					</div>
<!--					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What about Flames?</p>
					<div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> You can purchase pre-made flames from the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=366">Particle Flames</a> board in the Market section or going in game and clicking Setup&gt;Utils&gt;Flame Browser.<br/>
					<br/>You may also create your own flames by going ingame and clicking Setup&gt;Utils&gt;Flame Forger.<br/>
					<br/>To further customize your flames you may purchase a <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_shop_item.php?id=1424">Flame Particle Texture</a>, but note that you require at least one flame for this to do anything.</div>-->
