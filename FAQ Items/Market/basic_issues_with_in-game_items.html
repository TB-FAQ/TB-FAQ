            <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> If you see a brand-new set for Uke or yourself, delete Uke's or your own custom folder (located in /Toribash-x.x/Custom/) and rerun Toribash. Uke's or your own textures should be restored. (Note: The default installation location for Toribash is "C:/Games/Toribash-x.x/")
            <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> My textures are working on the forum, but not ingame, how can I fix this?</p>
            <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> After you've uploaded your textures, first make sure that the item(s) is/are activated. Once you've made sure they are, it should be noted that textures show up in roughly 5 minutes after being uploaded.</p>
            <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> I bought a flame texture but I don't see my flame in-game, what do I do?</p>
            <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Flame Textures are not the same as Flame Particles, the textures apply to a Flame Particle, so you need a Flame Particle first before you can use a Flame Texture.</p>
            <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> I uploaded a new Flame Particle Texture but it won't update, how do I update it?</p>
            <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Open the Toribash folder, in the folder, go to Custom and find your player name. Open the respective folder and delete the file named 'flame.tga'. Now open the game and type /download <insert your username> or /dl <insert your username> (ex: /download Tori).</p>
