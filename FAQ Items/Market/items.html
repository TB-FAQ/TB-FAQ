					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What are items?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Items are used to enhance the look and feel of the game, or as collectibles. A typical example of an item would be a joint color, such as the one shown below:<br/>
					<center><a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_shop_item.php?id=624"><img src="http://cache.toribash.com/forum/torishop/images/items/neptune_force.png" /></a></center></p>
					<br/><br/>
					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How can I get items?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> All items cost ToriCredits (TC) and can be bought in the Market from other players or from the Torishop. Some items are not available for TC in the ToriShop and can only be purchased with real currency. Most items require you to have a minimum amount of Qi before you can purchase or receive the item, and you need a minimum of 20 Qi to trade at all. The Qi requirement for an item can be found in the ToriShop. You may purchase an item with real currency even if you do not meet the Qi requirement.</p>
					<br/><br/>
					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do people earn all the TC for these items?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Winning in game on official servers gets you 10TC per win. Winning tournaments can get you anywhere from 50TC to 10000TC. Competing in and winning events can net you even greater quantities of TC, check the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=37">Events</a> board for details. Trading items or making and selling artwork in the market can also be profitable.
					<br/><br/>
					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do you use an item once you have bought it?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> To activate an item, go to the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori.php">Shop</a>, click on <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_inventory.php">Deactivated</a>, find the item, and then click [Activate].</p>
					<br/><br/>
					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What about Flames?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> You can purchase pre-made flames from the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=366">Particle Flames</a> board in the Market section or going in game and clicking Setup&gt;Utils&gt;Flame Browser.<br/>
					<br/>You may also create your own flames by going ingame and clicking Setup&gt;Utils&gt;Flame Forger.<br/>
					<br/>To further customize your flames you may purchase a <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_shop_item.php?id=1424">Flame Particle Texture</a>, but note that you require at least one flame for this to do anything.</p>
