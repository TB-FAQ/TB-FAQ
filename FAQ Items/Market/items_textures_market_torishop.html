					<h1>Items</h1>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What are items? </p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Items are used in the game to enhance the look and feel of the game, and as 'collectors items', typical examples of items are joint colours, an example is shown below.<br>
                    <img src="http://cache.toribash.com/forum/torishop/images/items/neptune_force.png" border="0" alt="" class="thumb"><br><br>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How can I get items? </p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> All items cost Toricredits (abv. TC) and are bought in the market from other players, or from the Torishop. You also need to have the requestions QI to accept the item, you need a minimum of 20 QI to trade, and all QI restrictions for each item can be found by browsing the items in the Torishop.</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Do items make you better in game?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> No, but you will look rather dapper.</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do people earn all the TC for these items?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Try these:<ul>
  <li>Winning in game on official servers gets you 10tc per win.</li>
  <li>Winning tournaments, can get you anything from 50tc to 10,000tc and more in the right tournaments.</li>
  <li>Winning events is also a good way to get TC, you can find out more in the events board.</li>
  <li>Trading items I the market believe it or not is also a good way, just buy for low and sell for high.</li>
  <li>Making and selling art for signatures, avatars and textures over the market also works a treat.</li>
</ul>
</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do you use an item once you have bought it?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Simply go to the Shop, then to your deactivated inventory, find the item and click 'activate'.<br>Shop: <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori.php" target="_blank">http://forum.toribash.com/tori.php</a><br>Deactived inventory: 
                    <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_inventory.php" target="_blank">http://forum.toribash.com/tori_inventory.php</a></p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What about flames?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> For flames, you can go <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=366" target="_blank">here</a> to buy pre-made ones, as well as going ingame and going to the menu screen and clicking Setup > Utils > Flame Browser.<br><br>

If you go ingame and hit escape, or are on the menu screen, you can go Setup > Utils > Flame Forger to make your own flames.<br><br>

A flame can have various effects depending on the way the forger manipulates it, but it it always centered around a chosen joint.<br><br>

When you have a flame, you can also apply an image to it as a flame particle. Flame particle images make each particle represent the image you apply to it.<br><br>

For more in depth, and how to use each specific tweak, you can look <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/showthread.php?t=90638" target="_blank">here</a>. (outdated source, but the concept is the same) </p><hr>
					<h1>Textures</h1>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What are textures?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Textures are a flat image wrapped to a 3D object, they give 'texture' to the object to make it look more detailed than it really is. In Toribash we used them to add customisation.<br><br>
To use textures, you need first the texture item for the object you want to texture (note that you can buy them in three different resolutions; 128x128, 256x256 and 512x512) and the image you are going to apply to this item. Below are a few images demonstrating textures.</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Where do I get the texture item for a particular body part?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Simply go to the Torishop, you can find what you need in the textures section.</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Where do I get the texture image?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> You make make one, buy one from the market, or get a friend to make you one.
There are also some free textures, which cane be found in the art board. Note that all textures must be 128x128, 256x256 or 512x512 pixels large, and in one of the accepted formats stated on the texture uploader.</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I use a texture once I have the item and image?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> First make sure the item is activated, just the same as any other item.
Now in your inventory go to 'textures' and find the texture item relevant.
(Note: you can also activate your texture item from this screen.)
Now click 'upload' and then select the correct file to upload from your computer.<br>

					<h1>Market</h1>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What is the 'Market' in Torishop, and what is the forum market?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> There are actually two markets, an automated personal market for every player, which sits in your inventory and in the 'market' section, and a forum for trade and auctioneering. The most major difference is that the automated market can't be used to sell art, so the forum market is used for that.
</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Does the market have better deals than Torishop?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Usually yes, sometimes no, items that are sold out normally cost more, while items that are in stock typically cost less.</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I use the automated market?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Simply go to the market using the button at the top on the same bar 'forum' and 'shop' are on, here you can browser for items to buy.
If you want to sell things, go to your inventory, find the item you want to sell and move it into your market inventory, you can double click an item to add a price.</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Are items available without QI restrictions?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Yes. These are only available from the marketeers. The link is <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_market.php?action=search&item=&username=Marketeers&max=&maxQi=" target="_blank">here.</a>
The term "No-QI" items means that a Torishop admin will send the item because they have the ability to bypass the QI restriction. QI always stays the same on the item. Never changes. Meaning, Once the item is placed into your account the QI restrictions are applied again. You cannot send it to anyone else without having the necessary QI.<br><br>Any items bought with real money have no QI limit. </p>

					<h1>ToriShop</h1>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Where is, what is and how do I use the Torishop?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> The Torishop is here: <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori.php" target="_blank">Link</a>
It's the main shop for the Toribash community, and is how the community gets its items. To use it just load the page and use the various search tools to find the item you want, also, you can go ingame and test these items out before buying them. The ToriShop can also be accessed by opening the main menu ingame and selecting "ToriShop". This can also be useful for previewing items.
</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> This item is out of stock, what do I do?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Items go out of stock when people buy lots of them, because people have bought lots of them there are plenty in the market, so go to the market to find it there.</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> When do items restock?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> The Torishop is restocked at the start of every month, GMT +1. Most marketers try to buy out the items rather quickly, so you might want to be ready at that time to purchase whatever item you want.</p>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I activate my items?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> First, go to your <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_inventory.php" target="_blank">deactivated items</a>. This is found in the toolbar to the left while in Torishop (or by following the link). <br>
Choose the item you wish to activate and click on the Activate button next to the item. Deactivating items is 
done the same way from your Activated items.</p>
