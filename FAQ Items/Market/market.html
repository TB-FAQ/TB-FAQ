                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What is the 'Market' in Torishop, and what is the forum market?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> There are actually two markets, an automated personal market for every player, which sits in your inventory and in the 'market' section, and a forum for trade and auctioneering. The most major difference is that the automated market can't be used to sell art, so the forum market is used for that.
					</div>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Does the market have better deals than Torishop?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Usually yes, sometimes no, items that are sold out normally cost more, while items that are in stock typically cost less.</div>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I use the automated market?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Simply go to the market using the button at the top on the same bar 'forum' and 'shop' are on, here you can browser for items to buy.
						If you want to sell things, go to your inventory, find the item you want to sell and move it into your market inventory, you can double click an item to add a price.
					</div>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Are items available without Qi restrictions?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Yes.
						<ul>
							<li>The <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_market.php?action=search&item=&username=Marketeers&max=&maxQi=" target="_blank">Marketeers market items</a> have no qi restriction on purchase.</li>
							<li>Packed Packs <em>(not sets)</em> have no Qi restriction, and can be purchased from anyone, regardless of the Qi restriction the items in it may have.</li>
							<li>Items won from official events are typically sent without regard for Qi restrictions.</li>
							<li>Though items purchased with Shiai Tokens are not usually Qi restricted, they will be sent without a Qi restriction.</li>
							<li>Items purchased through the ToriShop for real currency will not be subject to the Qi restriction.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="faq_importantInfo">
							Regardless of how it got there once an item is in your account, the normal Qi restriction will apply to any future trades.
