                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What are textures?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Textures are a flat image wrapped to a 3D object, they give 'texture' to the object to make it look more detailed than it really is. In Toribash we used them to add customisation.
						<p>To use textures, you need first the texture item for the object you want to texture (note that you can buy them in three different resolutions; 128x128, 256x256 and 512x512) and the image you are going to apply to this item. Below are a few images demonstrating textures.</p>
					</div>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Where do I get the texture item for a particular body part?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Simply go to the Torishop, you can find what you need in the Textures section.</div>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Where do I get the texture image?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> You make make one, buy one from the market, or get a friend to make you one.
						There are also some free textures, which cane be found in the art board. Note that all textures must be 128x128, 256x256 or 512x512 pixels large, and in one of the accepted formats stated on the texture uploader.</div>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I use a texture once I have the item and image?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> First make sure the item is activated, just the same as any other item.
						Now in your inventory go to 'textures' and find the texture item relevant.
						(Note: you can also activate your texture item from this screen.)
						Now click 'upload' and then select the correct file to upload from your computer.
