                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> The Torishop is here: <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori.php" target="_blank">Link</a>
					
						<p>The Torishop is the main shop for purchasing items for Toribash. To use it just load the page and use the various search tools to find the item you want.</p>
						
						<p>Using the ingame interface you can test these items out before buying them. The ToriShop can also be accessed by opening the main menu ingame and selecting "ToriShop". This can also be useful for previewing items.</p>
					</div>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> This item is out of stock, what do I do?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Items go out of stock when people buy lots of them. Even though the Torishop is solid out, the market may have some for sale.</div>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> When do items restock?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> The Torishop is restocked at the start of every month, GMT +1. Most marketers try to buy out the items rather quickly, so you might want to be ready at that time to purchase whatever item you want.</div>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I activate my items?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> From your deactivated items.
						<p>First, go to your <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/tori_inventory.php" target="_blank">deactivated items</a>.
						This is found in the toolbar to the left while in Torishop (or by following the link).
						Choose the item you wish to activate and click on the Activate button next to the item. Deactivating items is 
						done the same way from your Activated items.</p>
