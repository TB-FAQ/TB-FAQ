                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I start a clan war?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> The first step to creating a war, is being in a clan; The next step is going to the wars page which can be located <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/clan_war.php">here</a>, or on the side clan bar, or even under your clan's name, next you are ready to create a clan war, the interface may look scary at first, but it's easy to use once you understand it.</p>

                    <p class="faq_answer"> The first thing you will notice is the <b>Guest Clan</b> box, this is the name of the clan you want to war; Next is the <b>Game Limit</b> box, this is the amount of games total that the war will last; Finally we have the <b>First To</b> box, if this is set as 0, the war will win based on a most-out-of system, if it is used, then it will be a first-to system; Finally you can click the "Declare War" button to which the guest clan you have chosen earlier, will need to accept it; After the guest clan has accepted the war invite, you will need to click the <b>Load Items</b> button under the "War Setup" section, both clans will need to click a "Accept Items"/"Accept Prizes" button, and finally, the war will start <b>in the current in-game room you are in</b></p>
