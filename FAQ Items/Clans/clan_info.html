					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q: </span>How do I join a clan?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A: </span>Joining a clan is the easy part, once a member of the clan in question has sent out an invite you will navigate to <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/clan.php">clan.php</a> and accept the invite. Note: Usually before an invite is sent out you will have to apply for a clan. It is also worth mentioning that some clans are set to free for all, meaning they can join the can without an invite. </div>
                    
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q: </span>I'm in the clan now how do I war?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A: </span>Glad you asked! Once you're in the clan you will be able to participate in any war your clan has. However you will not be able to declare war unless someone gives you the permissions to do so.</div>
                    
                    <p><strong>Declaring and managing a war:</strong></p> <div>
                    <li>Once you have the proper permissions declare/manage a war within your clan, navigate to your <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/clan_war.php">clan wars</a>. Once you are viewing your clan's wars you will be able to see "War setup" here you can invite a clan to a war, set the game limit and the first to limit. Most of the time when clans are warring, it is good leave the game limit to default and set the first to: value anywhere from 7-10. After you send out a war invite, both clans will need to load items and accept prizes for the war to be locked in and ready.  </li> </div>
                    
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q: </span>Are there any differences between official and unofficial clans?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A: </span>Yes, official clans and unofficial clans are different. Generally the biggest giveaway between official and unofficial clans are the ingame tags. Unofficial clans will have ( ) tags where as official clans will have [ ] tags.</div>
                    
                    <p><strong>Official and unofficial clans:</strong></p>
                    <div><li>The main differences between official and unofficial clans are the tags, official clans have bracket tags [ ] where as unofficial clans have parentheses ( ). However there are more differences, like official clans get their own board <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=44">here</a>. Inside those boards they can post whatever they want, they even have their own local moderators, but global rules still apply in those boards. Unofficial clans however must be limited to a couple threads inside <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=97">clan discussion</a>. Unofficial clans also have to post their recruitment threads in <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=550">this subforum</a>. </li></div>
