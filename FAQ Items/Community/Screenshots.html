					<ul>
                        <li> Once you have a screenshot of toribash if you wish to upload it you must visit a third party website. Such as <a href="https://imgur.com/">imgur</a>, <a href="https://gyazo.com/">Gyazo</a>, <a href="http://puush.me/">puush</a>, or <a href="http://tinypic.com/index.php">tinypic</a>. Please note if you are reporting something, <strong>do NOT</strong> use the toribash forum's built in image uploader. It will make it difficult to read and you will most likely be asked to upload it to an image hosting site.  
               
                    </li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p><strong>Finding your screenshot:</strong></p>
                    <ul><li>It's very easy to find screenshots, if you install the standalone version of Toribash your screenshots will most likely be located in Local Disk (C:)/Games/Toribash-x.xx/screenshots. If you are using the steam version of Toribash they will most likely be located in Local Disk (C:)/Program Files(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Toribash/screenshots. </li></ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Posting the screenshot:</strong></p>
                      <ul><li>After you have uploaded your screenshot to an image hosting website, you can copy the image's link (right click and copy image address works best) and paste the link in between [img][/img] tags.</li></ul>
