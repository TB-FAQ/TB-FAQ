While you are not required to read these rules, not being aware of them is not and never will be an excuse to not follow them. Repeat offences are subject to increased punishments. Please note that while this post covers all of the basic rules, it is by no means a comprehensive list of every punishable action - a healthy dose of common sense does wonders in keeping one out of trouble.
                 <strong>  Please note that breaking some rules will have worse punishments than others.  </strong>

The server will award said TC to the person that succeeded in decapping the other person's tori. (assuming they also win the match)
 
What is rigging a Decap Prize? Rigging a DP means you are setting up the DP to be taken by a specific user or users, be that anyone including yourself. This does not matter if the DP has "your TC" in it. If TC was added to the DP it was donated and, once donated. Is no longer yours and you have NO CLAIM to it at that time or in the future. This means that any attempt to take the TC because "it was yours before you put it in" will be treated as a Decap Prize Rig. If you believe a DP was rigged, or you believe one is about to be rigged, please contact a Staff Member and/ or make a Scam Report. TAKE SCREENSHOTS and please try to provide a replay.
Secondary note: The type of server makes no difference, tournament, bet server, public etc. Decap is public prize and is to ALWAYS BE WON FAIRLY. Any deviation from this rule results in serious punishment.
As a further note, if the server is dying, you may not change the mod/rig the prize. The same rules apply, regardless of whether the server is ending.</li>
